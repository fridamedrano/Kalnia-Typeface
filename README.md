Kalnia is a display typeface with high contrast and delicate terminals for poster headlines. During the Victorian era, machines made mass production possible, changing design forever. Classical text typefaces didn’t satisfy the necessities of the time, and typography with bold and impactful letters appeared. Kalnia was born by this concept, inspired by the ‘fat faces’ of that time. 
Kalnia is a family with a total of eight styles. It includes four weights: Thin, Light, Regular, and Bold. Each one also has its normal and extended width adding: Thin Extended, Light Extended, Regular Extended, and Bold Extended.
The typeface also has a variable font with weight and width axes.
